# Detection of Pneumonia using Deep Learning
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using transfer learning with ResNet-50V2.

## Introduction
Pneumonia is a common and serious respiratory infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate detection of pneumonia is crucial for timely treatment and better patient outcomes. This project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically transfer learning with the ResNet-50V2 architecture, to automatically classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images collected from various sources. It is divided into two categories: pneumonia-positive(sick) and pneumonia-negative(normal). The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model leverages the power of transfer learning by utilizing the ResNet-50V2 architecture. Transfer learning allows us to take advantage of a pre-trained model's knowledge on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and adapt it to our specific task of pneumonia detection. By fine-tuning the model on our dataset, we can achieve better results with less training time.

## Dependencies
### The project code relies on the following libraries:

Python 3.10,
TensorFlow 2.0>=,
Keras,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
scikit-learn,

## Getting Started
To run the project code, follow these steps:

### i) Clone this repository to your local machine.
### ii) Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
### iii) Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder (details provided in the code comments).
### iv) Execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Results
After training the model, we evaluate its performance on the validation set. The results include accuracy to measure the model's effectiveness in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## Conclusion
By utilizing transfer learning with the ResNet-50V2 architecture, this project demonstrates a successful approach to pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The developed deep learning model shows promising results, and it can be further improved with more data and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
